7. Bot events are events that will be sent to your bot to be evaluated and acted upon.  
We'll add channels and direct message to allow our bot to respond to both.  Make sure to hit
SAVE when you're done!

12. Now its time to run the code in the repo and get your aws infra all set up.  Once that's done,
you'll recieve an output URL for the last step.  

13. Navigate back to "Event Subscriptions" on the left side.
Paste your URL into the text field and tab out of the field.  The slack API will attempt to
automatically connect to your API Gateway and verify your bot.  If all went well, you'll get a nice
green "verified"
